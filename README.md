# Hi there 👋

🌱 I am currently a Cognitive Science PhD Candidate at the University of Plymouth.

## 🔭 Projects

 * **[psp](https://github.com/lenarddome/psp)**: a tool for cognitive scientist to explore the complete parameter space of computational models and to discover their global behaviour - all their predictions.
 * **[Estimating Sample Size with Bayes Factor](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/power-bayesian.html)**: a complete worksheet worth a textbook chapter.  To my knowledge, this is the only accessible introduction to Bayesian Power Analysis with Monte Carlo for Psychologists. The worksheet is part of the larger Research Methods in R (RMINR), curated by Andy Wills. [RMINR](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/)  is a set of guides on how to use R as your central research methods tool.
 * **Computational Modelling**: I am always implementing formal models from Psychology and attempting to replicate simulations, so you don't have to 🌝 Most of my model implementations can be found in [catlearn](https://www.andywills.info/catlearn/), an archive of formal models of categorization and associative learning in psychology.

I will always share what I do for free. You will be able to edit, remix, use my code and software given you share yours under the same license. So, if you are using any of my software, consider buying me a coffee ☕ I will go to my favourite coffee shop and continue to code endlessly 💻
